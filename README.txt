This is a series of games that are 1,024 bytes or less in size for the NES. This means all components of the game are included in the 1k; code, graphics, sound, vectors, etc. Even though the final build of each game is 16kb, only the last 1k of space is utilized so that it can still be used on the hardware.

Each directory is a different game that has their own batch file with which to build.
